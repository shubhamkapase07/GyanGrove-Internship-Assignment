Design and Technical Decisions
Font and Color: The website utilizes the Inter font for text, with font colors of #1E2022 for headings and #989090 for subtitles. The background color is set to #ffffff, while the logo color is #CF2D2D. Stroke/border color is #B0BABF.

API Integration: The website effectively fetches, uses, and displays data from a REST API to populate both the recommended shows and upcoming events sections. The API endpoints used for fetching data are provided in the project description.

Horizontal Scrolling: The recommended events section supports horizontal scrolling, allowing users to browse through a list of recommended shows effortlessly.

Lazy Loading: To optimize performance, upcoming events are fetched page by page. The next page of events is fetched from the API only when the user has scrolled to the end of the website. A small loading spinner is displayed while fetching the next page of events.

CSS: The website's color scheme and font usage align with the provided specifications, ensuring consistency and visual appeal across different sections.
